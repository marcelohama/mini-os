# mini-os

Mini Operational System. A simple operational system created with assembly and C.
Using very simple and old technologies such as Assembly language, this project implements a diskete-bootable OS with file system and proccess kernel. There are two daemon proccess files which you can use to test the OS. To run it, its a good idea to create a virtual machine.
